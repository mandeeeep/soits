			<h1>Welcome Note</h1>
			<div class="descr">On behalf of the Soits Community</div>
<p>St. Xavier's College, Kathmandu, is an educational institution of higher learning established in 1988 and managed by the Nepal Jesuit Society. Jesuits began their educational work in Nepal in 1951 with the opening of St. Xavier's School, Godavari, followed by St. Xavier's School, Jawalakhel and St. Xavier's School, Deonia.</p>
<p>Jesuits have served people of all faiths, all over the world, as educators, scientists, explorers and social reformers since 1540. That centuries old tradition of service to others is the cornerstone of Jesuit education. Education at Xavier's prepares each student to live and lead in all the endeavors. It fosters critical thinking, positive action and service to others. It challenges students to go beyond career preparation. It encourages the student to be job creators rather than job seekers, creative designers of the future. </p>
